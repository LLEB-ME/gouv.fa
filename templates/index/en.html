		<p> PubServ.fa is now Gouv.fa. This is an effort to consolidate the slew of domains we were using for services provided by the Farer Governing Body. Redirects will continue from PubServ.Fa to Gouv.fa until the end of September.</p>

		<h2>üöß Caution!</h2>
		<p> Some services such as online forms via Gouv.fa and FarerNIC may not be live yet as part of our rebrand to <a href="https://github.com/LLEB-ME/wiki/issues/16">Farer.</a> We appreciate and thank you for your patience as we rollout more over time.</p>

		Use the Discord server to talk with anyone. <a href="https://github.com/LLEB-ME/wiki/issues/4">We're working on replacing Discord,</a> but leaving some means to mirror conversations for those not ready to make the leap. <strong>If there is an urgent issue, <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIB4aklX7oIdMxAQGz5k01VjSn0q72AbkSBOWPlYP9ipUEhAg14RS_NU5lSVarHEL58XF">use Signal to contact the staff.</a></strong> Verify identites before communicating with internal means.
