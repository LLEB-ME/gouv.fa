## Building and Deploying
0. Install [Zola](https://getzola.org) (minimum version v0.17)
1. Build the site (`zola build`) or serve changes locally (`zola serve`)
2. Push to Git.
  - Pushing to GitHub is being deprecated in favour of Git.fa (soon)
  - Pushing to Git.fa will require a pull request to make changes. The `main` branch will automatically build and serve any changes to the website, both [internally](https://gouv.fa) and [publicly.](https://farer.group)
