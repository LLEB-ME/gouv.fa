Farer is the culmination of distaste with the public Internet. It has grown centralised and focused around a very small set of services that aren't good. The solution for many: self-hosting. Instead of Spotify, use Plex. Instead of Alexa, use Mycroft. The list is long and this page really shouldn't be. Farer is made to be a private Internet (more aptly, intranet)â€” it is resilient to outages and dependent on its members rather than third-party service providers. We provide the servers, we provide the services, we provide the support. ... ... ...

The Farer Group is the team behind Farer. ... ... ...

Membership is exclusive to those who are members and those who are invited by members. The circle of trust will persist.

The difference between Farer and The Farer Group is simple: **The** Farer **Group** is **the group** behind Farer. Farer is the "product", The Farer Group is who is making the "product."
