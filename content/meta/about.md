The Farer Network is a co-operation of people around the world running an Intranet that's intended to be supplement to the public Internet. It serves as the primary solution for a complexity we've all had: self-hosting. Port forwarding, domain management, et al.— Farer is meant to act a solution for us to be able to have a priavte intranet that is resilient to outages and dependent on its members rather than third-party services provides. We provide the servers, the services, the support— we're (relatively speaking) soverign.

### About The Farer Group
The Farer Group is the general body that runs Farer— it maintains [the common standards services using the IDP service](/fedlex/) are expected to follow, it helps members and visitors alike find out everything they need to know with Farer (through this website and its internal counterpart).

Membership is exclusive to those who are members and those who are invited by members. This circle of trust will persist forever. Members are able to choose if they want to display to others that they are a member or not— staff are obligated.
