The Farer Group are the minds behind an intranet that is intended to be a supplement for the public Internet. The primary solution for the longest time has been one of great complexity: self-hosting. Port forwarding, domain management, DNS, et al., et al. The Farer Network, better yet Farer, is made to be the solution: a private intranet that is resilient to outages and dependent on its members rather than third-party service providers. We provide the servers, we provide the services, we provide the support.

Membership is exclusive to those who are members and those who are invited by members. The circle of trust will persist forever.
