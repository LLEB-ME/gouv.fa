There are two fonts that should be used:
  - **Overpass—** intended for all text that isn't code or similar. This can be linked via `https://gouv.fa/assets/overpass.css`.
  - **ZZZZZZ—** intended for code or other scenarios where a monospace font makes sense. This can be linked via `https://gouv.fa/assets/ZZZZZZ.css`

Fonts should be set to:
  - a base font size of 1.075rem (about 13px)
  - a line height of 1.3
  - have a proper fallback (`"Overpass", sans-serif`, `"ZZZZZZ", monospace`)
