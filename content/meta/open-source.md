### Deprecated software and projects
This is a collection of software that we have used in the past or have developed in-house for usage within Farer, but have either deprecated or stop utilising.

- CentOS, in favour of Alpine Linux
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/), in favour of Ansible
- [Dnsmasq](http://thekelleys.org.uk/git/dnsmasq.git), in favour of CoreDNS
- [NGINX](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx.org), in favour of Caddy
