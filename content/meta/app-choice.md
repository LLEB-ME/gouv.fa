## Choosing services
We meticulously choose services to help make sure we don't spend unnecessary time troubleshooting bugs, scrapping servers, and restarting from scratch. Anything we host must be:
- open-source with an open-source license
- able to use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard 
- support encryption by some means (in transit, at rest, end-to-end, et al.).

We do not choose services that may void your privacy or ours and do our best to limit all services to inside our network. We ensure services can be used across nodes to allow our international friendliness and general failure prevention.

## Choosing clients
When choosing clients, we have a "strict" criteria and a "loose" criteria. Both are flexible in additions, but must have all of these prerequisites:
- free to download
- open-source with an open-source license
- private or able to easily make private
- has stable support for our services.

You do not have to use the clients that we recommend; in fact, we suggest that you still do research into finding or making a client that works best for you. Our recommendations are purely meant to serve as a suggestion to getting up and running reliably.
