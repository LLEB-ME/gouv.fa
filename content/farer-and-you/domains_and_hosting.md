# Getting a domain name
You are able to register a `.fa` or `.farer` domain by:
- contacting staff members via a [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email)
- [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/farer-group/self-nic/issues/new)
- [registering via the FarerNIC](https://nic.fa)

GitHub issues and emails should contain a body that resembles the following:
```
Domain(s): example.fa / example.farer
Reason for registration: Loreum ipsum
IP address to point to: 100.x.y.z AND (public IPv4) AND, if applicable (public IPv6)
```

Certificates are generated automatically and given to you for usage with your domain. We enforce HTTPS on `.fa` and `.farer` domains, bar those that we cannot logically enforce; exceptions are seldom.

Domain names are public to everyone in the Farer Group and cannot be made private. Just like the normal Internet, however, users must find your domain by some means to be able to know about it.

**Certain domain names will be rejected,** namely those that imply affiliation with the Farer staff, the Farer group, or specific members of Farer staff. Other domain names may be prohibited from creation at the discretion of staff members.

## Getting your domain hosted inside the Farer network
If you already have a domain outside of Farer, you can request Git access to be able to mirror your website inside of Farer group to other Farer members the fastest speeds to your website. Your request should be done in a similar fashion, ommiting the reason for registration and replacing it with a proof of ownership.
