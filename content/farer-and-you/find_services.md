title= "Finding community services"

As of 21 March, 2022, we don't have a searX instance spun-up yet. Once we do, a custom engine will be provided to allow searching not only community services, but the internet as a whole privately.

We do not maintain an official index of services; however, [we do offer a status page](https://status.fa) that can be accessed to see what services are live. This is the closest to a web index that we have as of writing.
