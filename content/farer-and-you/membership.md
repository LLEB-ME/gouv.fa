## Terms of membership
By being a Farer Group member, certain rules apply.
- **Follow contribution guidelines—** any content hosted on our servers must meet or exceed guidelines, where appropriate.
- **Don't be a dick.**
- **Be generally neutral—** There is a time and place for politics, religion, et al. This is a place to enjoy life, however, not to start a rally. If you want support for a rally, use public social media like [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [a subreddit.](https://old.reddit.com)
- **Follow common sense—** Do not exploit flaws you may find in community services. Write a staff member directly or email `security@gov.fa` (ext. `security@farer.group`).
- **Treat community services like your own—** do not flood traffic to any servers, attempt to circumvent [the ACL](/tailscale/ACL.json), or abuse the data you may have access to.
- **Be fluent in one or more official languages—** We currently use three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. We consider requests to add new official languages and to provide unofficial translations in other languages. Pull requests are welcome to further translations. **Unofficial translations must declare what the official languages are and where to find official documentation.**
- **Be creative and stupid—** The Farer Group in it of itself is a passion project. We wanted to make something that really hasn't been tried to the scale that we're trying right now: an internet gone intra. We're being stupid because it's not realistic. Challenge the norm. Make stupid mistakes. Learn from them.

## Inviting others into Farer
**Note:** this policy is being proposed to be changed. [You can view the proposal here.](https://github.com/LLEB-ME/wiki/issues/20)

You cannot currently directly invite someone into Farer Group, **however** you can recommend to a staff member that someone is. Recommendations should outline clearly reasons why that person would be a good fit for Farer Group. You must affirm and attest that that person will follow the terms of membership. Failure for them to do so within an undescribed teething period may result in the suspension or removal of both them and yourself from Farer Group.

## Leaving the Farer Group
Leaving the Farer group is not recommended, even if you plan not to use its services anymore. Those who leave will not be re-admitted into the network. Upon your ultimate decision to leave the Farer Group, you can [request to delete your Tailscale account](https://tailscale.com/contact/support/), [uninstall Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1069/uninstall/?q=uninstall), and [delete your GitHub account.](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/deleting-your-user-account) To delete any data stored on you, as well as get a copy of all identifiable data collected, please request directly to a Farer staff member.
