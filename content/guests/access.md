## Accessing the Farer network at or for an event
In-person events will provide access to the Farer network at a router level. You should not have to make any changes to be able to access `.farer` and `.fa` domains.

Online events will require users to download and install the [Tailscale application](https://tailscale.com) to be able to access the network. The people running the event will provide an invite link that allows you to access the network.

Those at either in-person events or online events will need to [install the root certificates.](/members/root-ca)

## Accessing the Farer network outside of events
Currently, the Farer network is not permitted outside of events for visitors. This website is the extent of Farer outside of the network for visitors and members of the public.
