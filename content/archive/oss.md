title= "Deprecated software and projects"
+++

This is a collection of software that we have used in the past or have developed in-house for usage within Farer, but have either deprecated or stop utilising.

- CentOS, in favour of other Linux distros (namely Alpine Linux)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/), in favour of K3s
- [Dnsmasq](http://thekelleys.org.uk/git/dnsmasq.git), in favour of CoreDNS
- [NGINX](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx.org), in favour of Caddy
- [Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale), in favour of vanilla Wireguard and a homebrew mesh solution (pending switch [via order #0003](https://pubserv.fa/fedlex/O0003))
