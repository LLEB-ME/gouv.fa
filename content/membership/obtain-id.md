When you join Farer, you gain access to our intranet and services. However, if you misplace your credentials or lose access by other means, you will need to prove your identity to be re-admitted at the discretion of a staff member.

If you became a member after 14 May, 2022, then you will be provided with a digital ID card. You will soon have access to an "Add to Apple Wallet" and "Add to Google Wallet" options to save it to your iPhone both upon initial provision or [via the Gouv.fa dashboard](https://sec.gouv.fa/dashboard)

Your physical ID card never expires, neither does your digital ID card. Cards added to Apple Wallet and Google Wallet may expire after a period of time and require being re-added via Gouv.fa. ID cards will be revoked digitally upon renouncing Farer membership.

## Applying for an ID card
1. **Gather your documentsâ€”** you will need to be able to prove your identity, as well as your membership via the intranet. Documents that can be useful are:
  - emails from GitHub with invites that are postmarked and include the email address tied to your GitHub account publicly,
  - the private certificate file of your FarerNIC's HTTPS certificate,
  - the public key of your `.fa` domain, amongst others.
2. **[Submit your request.](https://sec.gouv.fa/request/id)**

Your first ID card is free. Replacements are 5 USD per card, plus the cost of shipping with the original card's information being destroyed. You can request a replacement by following the same procedure as above. Payment must be completed via Zelle transfer, if in the United States, or via a cash equivalent at the time of postmark.
