When you join Farer, you gain access to our intranet and services. However, if you misplace your credentials or lose access by other means, you will need to prove your identity to be re-admitted at the discretion of a staff member.

If you became a member after 14 May, 2022, then you will be provided with a digital ID card. You will soon have access to an "Add to Apple Wallet" option to save it to your iPhone both upon initial provision or [by requesting the badge again online.](https://gouv.fa/id-request)

Your physical ID card never expires, neither does your digital ID card. Cards added to Apple Wallet may expire after a period of time and require being re-added via Gouv.fa. ID cards will be revoked digitally upon renouncing Farer membership.

## Applying for an ID card
1. **Gather your documents—** you will need to be able to prove your identity, as well as your membership via the intranet. Documents that can be useful are:
  - emails from GitHub with invites that are postmarked and include the email address tied to your GitHub account publicly,
  - the private certificate file of your FarerNIC's HTTPS certificate,
  - the public key of your `.fa` domain, amongst others.
2. **Take a passport photo—** this will need to be at least 4 inches by 6 inches large. Digital submissions are possible if the photo is in excess of 1200x1800 pixels. The photo should be:
  - colour accurate with no shadows on the person's face,
  - without sunglasses on your face (prescription is OK without a glare),
  - with the head centred, fully in frame, and unobstructed (religious and medicial headgear OK as long as no shadows obscure the face)
  - not digitally altered (even if "red-eye" occurs),
  - in a neutral expression facing the camera,
  - a plain white or off-white background.
3. **[Submit your request.](https://gouv.fa/id-request)**

Your first ID card is free. Replacements are 5 USD per card, plus the cost of shipping with the original card's information being destroyed. You can request a replacement by following the same procedure as above. Payment must be completed via Zelle transfer, if in the United States, or via a cash equivalent at the time of postmark.
