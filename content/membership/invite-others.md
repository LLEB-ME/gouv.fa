As a user, [you have the right](/membership/user-rights) to be able to invite other users to the network. You cannot directly invite someone into the Farer Group. Invitations are done via recommendations. Recommendations must outline clearly the person's technological history and prove general competence to use Farer services. 

**You must affirm and attest that the person you invite will [follow the terms of membership.](@/membership/user-rights.md)** Failure for such may result in the suspension or removal of both the person invited and you from Farer. On GitHub, you would end the request with the following:
```
