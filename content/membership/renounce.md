Leaving Farer is not recommended, even if you plan not to use its services anymore. Those who leave will not be re-admitted into the network. Upon your ultimate decision to leave the Farer group, you must submit a Declaration of Renouncement

## Filing a Declaration of Renouncement
1. **Gather documentsâ€”** you need to prove your identity before reonouncing your membership. This can only be done with official documents such as an [ID card or certificate of membership.](/N1002)
2. **[Submit a request via Gouv.la](https://sec.gov.fa/renounce-request)**

After submitting your request, you should wait to delete Tailscale from your devices for a confirmation of your renouncement. After this, you may want to:
- [delete your Tailscale account](https://tailscale.com/contact/support/)
- [uninstall Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1069/uninstall/?q=uninstall)
- [delete your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/deleting-your-user-account)

After you receive a certificate of renouncement, any data stored on you will be purged from Farer servers except the following:
- official documents (eg. ID card, certificate of membership); and:
- your name and surname.
