## User rights
You are granted certain rights by being a member of the Farer network:
- **The ability to have a secure, private place to store your data**,
- **The ability to invite others into the Farer network**; and:
- **The ability to access services and content regardless of geographical location**.

## User obligations within Farer
As a user of Farer services, you are obligated to follow certain rules within the network:
- **Follow contribution guidelines—** any content hosted on our servers must meet or exceed guidelines, where appropriate.
- **Don't be a dick.**
- **Be generally neutral—** There is a time and place for politics, religion, et al. This is a place to enjoy life, however, not to start a rally. If you want support for a rally, use public social media like [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [a subreddit.](https://old.reddit.com)
- **Follow common sense—** Do not exploit flaws you may find in community services. Write a staff member directly or email `security@gouv.fa` (ext. `security@farer.group`).
- **Treat community services like your own—** do not flood traffic to any servers, attempt to circumvent <abbr title="Access-Control Lists">ACLs</abbr>, or abuse the data you may have access to.
- **Be fluent in one or more official languages—** We currently use three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. We consider requests to add new official languages and to provide unofficial translations in other languages.
