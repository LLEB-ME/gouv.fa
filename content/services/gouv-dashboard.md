Your Gouv.fa account is pertinent to your membership. It allows access to:
- a downloadable copy of your [certificate of membership](@/membership/obtain-certificate.md),
- downloadable copies of your [membership invitations](@/membership/invite-others.md),
- a downloadble copy of your digital ID card,
- your data and the scopes requested by services using Gouv.fa for logins; and:
- the Farer network.

This account acts as your hub for all things administrative-wise in Farer. It cannot be signed in with the Farer <abbr title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr> service, but is used to create your Farer SSO credentials. It acts as a honeypot for your membership documentation and related documents.

Upon joining, you are provided with a username (commonly your first initial and last name) and a randomly generated password. Upon your first login, you are given the choice to create another username to login with (your initial username will still work) and are required to change your password. Strict password standards are employed for this account.

## Lost credentials
In the event of losing your Gouv.fa password, you must use your AdA or other documents proving your membership to have it reset to a random temporary password that you can then use to login again. There are no exceptions to this policy to allow utmost security to your confidential documents and the data you store in services connected with the Farer SSO service.
