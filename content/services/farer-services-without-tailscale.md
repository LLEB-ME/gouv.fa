If you are unable to use Tailscale on a device due to the lack of a client and are therefore unable to connect to Farer services, there are some workarounds that are available.

## Using the public DNS resolver
Some services are accessible while not using a VPN. These services are:
- Gouv.fa— accessible via [gouv.farer.group](https://gouv.farer.group) using your Gouv.fa credentials
- Single sign-on— accessible via [sso.farer.group](https://sso.farer.group)

You can find the public IP address for DNS servers via Tailscale's website or by requesting to a staff member.
