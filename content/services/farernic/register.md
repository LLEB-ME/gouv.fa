You are able to register a `.fa` domain by:
- contacting staff members via a [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email)
- [registering via the FarerNIC](https://nic.fa/register-domain)

Emails should be sent `register-domain@nic.fa` contain a body that resembles the following:
```
Domain(s): example.fa
Reason for registration: Loreum ipsum
IP address to point to: 100.x.y.z AND (public IPv4) AND, if applicable (public IPv6)
```

Certificates are generated automatically and given to you for usage with your domain. We enforce HTTPS on `.fa` domains, bar those that we cannot logically enforce; exceptions are seldom.

Domain names are public to everyone in the Farer Group and cannot be made private. Just like the normal Internet, however, users must find your domain by some means to be able to know about it.

**Certain domain names will be rejected,** namely those that imply affiliation with the Farer staff, the Farer group, specific members of Farer staff, or refer to or directly correlate to a political bias and/or have the intent to void the membership rules. Other domain names may be prohibited from creation at the discretion of staff members.
