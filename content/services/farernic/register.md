### Registering a .FA domain
You are able to register a `.fa` domain by:
- contacting staff members via a [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email)
- [registering via the FarerNIC](https://nic.fa/register-domain)

Emails should be sent `register-domain@nic.fa` contain a body that resembles the following:
```
Domain(s): example.fa
Reason for registration: Loreum ipsum
IP address to point to: 100.x.y.z AND (public IPv4) AND, if applicable (public IPv6)
```

Certificates are generated automatically and given to you for usage with your domain. We enforce HTTPS on `.fa` domains, bar those that we cannot logically enforce; exceptions are seldom.

Certain subdomains are have restricted registration, but are available for those with the appropriate permissions:
  - `gouv.fa`— reserved for The Farer Group and its organisations
  - `intl.fa`— reserved for international governments that have servers inside Farer
  - `edu.fa`— reserved for educational entities that have servers inside Farer
  - `ac.fa`— reserved for academic research entities that have servers inside Farer
  - `lib.fa`— reserved for archival and library services that have servers or provide services inside Farer

### Registering a .Farer domain
You are able to register a `.farer` domain by containg staff members via a [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email)

Emails should be sent to `register-domain@nic.fa` and contain a body that resembles the following:
```
Domain: example.farer
IP address to point to 100.x.y.z AND (public IPv4) AND, if applicable (public IPv6)
Registration referrer: John Doe
Reason for registration: Loreu ipsum
```

`.farer` domains are not allowed for the general public to register. They require a referral and are reserved for the following purposes:
  - The Farer Group and its organisations,
  - server roots (`eevee.farer`, `lleb.farer`) run by server maintainers; and:
  - in-person or online events using the Farer network.

### Domain name policy 
Domain names are public to everyone in the Farer Group and cannot be made private. Just like the normal Internet, however, users must find your domain by some means to be able to know about it.

**Certain domain names will be rejected,** namely those that imply affiliation with the Farer staff, the Farer group, specific members of Farer staff, or refer to or directly correlate to a political bias and/or have the intent to void the membership rules. Other domain names may be prohibited from creation at the discretion of staff members.
