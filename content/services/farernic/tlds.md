### .FARER domains
.FARER domains are open for registration but restricted for certain usage:
  - The Farer Group and its organisations,
  - server roots (`eevee.farer`, `lleb.farer`) and server regions (`us-west.farer`, `europe.farer`)— run by server maintainers; and:
  - in-person or online events using the Farer network.

Registration of a .FARER is done via plain-text email to `register-domain@nic.fa` and contain a body that follows this template:
```
Domain: example.farer.
Farer IP address: 100.x.y.z
Public IPv4: 1.2.3.4
Public IPv6 (if applicable): ::fa0
Reason for registration: Lorem ipsum
```

### .FA domains
.FA domains are open for registration to all Farer members. Registration is done [via the FarerNIC](https://nic.fa/register-domain). Certificates are genreated automatically and given to you for usage with your domain. HTTPS is enforced on .FA domains, bar those that cannot be logically enforced; exceptions are seldom and made verifiable via FarerNIC's website.

### .FA subdomains
There are certain subdomains that are owned and maintained by The Farer Group. They are open for registration but restricted for certain usage based on the domain.
  - `gouv.fa`— reserved for The Farer Group and its organisations
  - `intl.fa`— reserved for international governments and their organisations that have servers inside Farer
  - `edu.fa`— reserved for educational entities
  - `ac.fa`— reserved for academic research entities
  - `lib.fa`— reserved for archival and library services that have servers or provide services inside Farer

### Domain name policy
Domain names are public to all members in the Farer Group and cannot be made private. Just like the normal Internet, however, users must find your domain by some means to be able to know about it.

**Certain domain names will be rejected,** namely those that imply affiliation with the Farer staff, the Farer group, specific members of Farer staff, or refer to or directly correlate to a political bias and/or have the intent to void the membership rules. Other domain names may be prohibited from creation at the discretion of staff members.
