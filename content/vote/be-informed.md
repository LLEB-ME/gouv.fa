title= "Be an Informed Voter"
+++

When a policy has been presented for a vote, it is pertinent that you exercise your right to vote on it. Likewise, when a policy that has been implemented is disliked, it is pertinent that you exercise your right to repeal it. There are several things you can do to be an informed voter when it comes time to vote on policies.

### Understand your rights as a Farer member
Farer members should understand the rights that they have and actively combat attempts that infringe upon them. A copy of "2022-001: The Rights and Obligations of Farer Members" can be found in [The Libraries](https://lib.fa/law/fa/2022-001), as well as in the [Fedlex](/fedlex/2022-001).

### Stay informed through social media and other platforms
You should be a member of The Farer Group's Discord server, as well as an active participant in discussions to help guide decisions to make quality policies that can be implemented without issue.

### Participate in public discussions
Discussions are frequent to make quality policies and implement meaningful changes to the Farer network.

Contributions do not always mean having a deep knowledge of computing or programmingâ€” often, people can provide meaningful feedback without this professional knowledge. It is encouraged, regardless, to pick up these skills.
