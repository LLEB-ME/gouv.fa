In some Farer regions, authorities may issue a Regional Resident Card. This non-standard card allows individuals to substitute other forms of identification when submitting requests via mail to a regional institution. Not all regions have Regional Resident Cards. The ones that do are:
  - [Farer in Europe](/papers#documents-issued-by-farer-in-europe)

These cards are printed in-house in French, English, and whatever applicable local languages. They contain the following data:
  - the bearer's name (John Doe),
  - the date issued (1997-01-06),
  - the bearer's date of joining Farer (1997-01-06),
  - the year and month the bearer registered within the region (1997-01),
  - the card's number (RRC-AA000000); and, in some cases:
  - an NFC chip that stores all this data.

Cards vary in style from region to region, usually featuring designs based on the location they originate from. There may be security measures in palce such as NFC chip signing to prevent tampering, holographic stickers that are resilient to peeling, or other measures. Security measures vary based on the issuing region.
