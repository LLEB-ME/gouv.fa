title= "Accessing Farer via Local Network"
+++

When events are organised or when connected to a WiFi network that uses the Farer network, you do not need any third-party software to be able to access anything within the Farer network. Members will need their Farer credentials to be able to authenticate to the WiFiâ€” guests can still get access to the network if the network administrator allows guests in software.

Networks that are intended for Farer access will use the Farer Authentication Service and will use either no password or WPA3 Enterprise. The latter requires the use of your Farer credentials to the network and may prevent the need to log in to the Farer Authentication Service to access your data and services.
