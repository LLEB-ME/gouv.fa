title= "Accessing Farer via Tailscale/Wireguard"
+++

Many Farer members access Farer using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), a Wireguard-based VPN that makes connections simple. Farer uses Tailscale as a backbone for all remote connections.

Connecting via Farer requires [a GitHub account](https://github.com) and the manual addition of your GitHub account to the [Farer organisation.](https://github.com/lleb-me) Work is being made to automate this process by linking your GitHub account to your Farer credentials.

1. Sign up [for GitHub](https://github.com) and [contact your regional staff member](/meta/contact) to be added to the organisation.
2. Download [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download)â€” there are no official download mirrors hosted by Tailscale or Farer within Farer.
3. Log in to Tailscale using your GitHub account. When prompted to choose a network, select `LLEB-ME`, `FARERGROUP` or `the farer group`
4. Ensure that "Use Tailscale DNS settings" is enabled by clicking on the Tailscale icon in your taskbar and looking under "Preferences". This setting will be used by default on mobile and does not require confirming.
