As a member of the Farer network, you are given certain rights, in addition to those outlined [in other policies](/fedlex):
  - **The right to your privacy**,
  - **The right to equal and fair treatment,**,
  - **The ability to access services and content regardless of geographical location**,
  - **The ability to rescind your membership**; and: others outlined in [2022-001: The Rights and Obligations of Farer Members](/fedlex/2022-001)

### Member obligations
Members must adhere to a basic ruleset:
  - **Be generally neutral—** there is a time and a place for politics, religion, et al. This is a place to enjoy life, however, not to start a rally. If you want support for a rally, use public social media like [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [a subreddit.](https://old.reddit.com)
  - **Follow common sense—** do not exploit flaws you may find in community services. Write a staff member directly or email `security@gouv.fa` (ext. `security@farer.group`).
  - **Treat community services like your own—** do not flood traffic to any servers, attempt to circumvent <abbr title="Access-Control Lists">ACLs</abbr>, or abuse the data you may have access to.
  - **Be fluent in one or both official languages—** We currently use two official languages: English and French. Fluency in one of these languages is required— fluency in boht is recommended.
  - **Don't be a dick.**

Members who run services may be obligated to follow other rules [outlined in other policies.](/fedlex)
