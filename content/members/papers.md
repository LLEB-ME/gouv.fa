Farer members are given certain documents upon enrolment to:
  - prove their identity within Farer,
  - recover lost access to the Farer network; and:
  - access benefits associated with being a Farer member.

Members are given a plastic ID card and a Certificate of Membership. It is expected that members keep these documents secure as replacements are at the expense of the member, including postage.
