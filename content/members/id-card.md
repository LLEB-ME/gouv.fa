ID cards are printed in-house in both French and English. They contain the following data:
  - the bearer's name (John Doe),
  - the date issued (1997-01-06),
  - the bearer's date of joining (1997-01-06),
  - the card's number (AA000000); and:
  - an NFC chip that stores all this data.

There are some security measures in place such as signing the contents of the chip to prevent tampering, as well as holographic stickers that are resilient to peeling. These stickers vary based on the issuing region— which cannot be decided by the bearer.
