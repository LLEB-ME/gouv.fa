+++

Certificates of membership are printed in-house in both French and English. They contain the following data:
  - the bearer's name (John Doe),
  - the bearer's date of joining (1997-01-06),
  - the certificate's number (AA000000); and:
  - the bearer's ID number (AA000000).

Certificates are stamped or signed by an issuing authority and sent digitally or via post, depending on how the request is made.

Some certificates may be written in French, English, and Spanish. This is because of prior language requirements while Farer was known as the LLEB Intranet.
