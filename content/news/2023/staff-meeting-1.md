## Agenda
- [Discussion on documenting best practices](#discussion-on-documenting-best-practices)

### Discussion on documenting best practices
Led by: Matthew RONCHETTO<br>
Discussion points:
  - As of 16 May, 18 machines required an update (4 were Farer machines, the rest were members)
  - As of 16 May, 12 machines had expired keys
  - As of 16 May, 2 of 5 Farer machines were offline (one since 5 Sep, other since 14 Feb)

  How do we fix uptime issues, help engage members to prevent key expiry, and inform members to keep their Tailscale client up to date ?
