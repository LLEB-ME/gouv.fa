The Farer Group has recently implemented the Farer Design System, a style guideline for websites maintained by The Farer Group and sets the standards for web development internally.

## Font: Overpass and JetBrains Mono
TODO: Discuss Overpass

Establishing the standard for a monospaced font came with relative ease: JetBrains Mono is a common font on the Internet that has been seen time and time again to be one of the best open-licensed fonts to date for code and similar applications.

Fonts are hosted internally, using both variable and standard WOFF2 files, with support for OTF, TTF, and WOFF being neglected based on a survey of members and the browsers they use, where WOFF2 is supported by all users alongside variable fonts. Support for OTF or WOFF could easily be added, but is not necessary at the time of writing.

## Colours: Monotone with comic book colours
The usage of black and white is prevalent throughout the design of Farer's websites, since the beginning. We bring these colours to their utmost extremes and replace the old red accent with 3 new colours that are meant to be used throughout the design system.

The new colours draw vague inspiration from the bold and punchy colours of comic books, while still remaining professional and easy on the eyes. Red, green, and blue are used to call reference to the techy background of Farer, with RGB being how colours are commonly referenced to on displays and the like.

## Conclusion
The new design system should allow a consistent and predictable web experience for Farer members, as well as make online resources provided by The Farer Group easier to understand. You can [view the new design system here](/meta/design) or by clicking the "Farer Design System" link in the footer.
