## Terms of membership
By being a LLEB member, certain rules apply.
- **Follow contribution guidelines—** any content hosted on our servers must meet or exceed guidelines. We want to enjoy the content we have, not wish we could have something better.
- **Don't be a dick—** Dicks are not allowed in LLEB. If somehow you found a way in, you'll get the boot soon enough.
- **Be generally neutral—** We don't want your politics, religion, et al. Activism is cool, don't get us wrong (we love our data privacy, FOSS, et al.); however, this is a place to enjoy life, not to start a rally. If you want support for a rally, use public social media like [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [a subreddit.](https://old.reddit.com)
- **Follow common sense—** Do not exploit flaws you may find in LLEB services. Don't prop them up like a trophy for all to see. Write a staff member directly: be it through any official communication medium for LLEB (Signal, Discord) or direct email using PGP encryption to a staff member.
- **Treat LLEB services like your own—** do not flood traffic to any servers, attempt to circumvent [the ACL](/tailscale/ACL.json), or abuse the data you may have access to.
- **Be fluent in one or more official languages—** we currently use three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. [We are considering the addition of German or Chinese.](https://github.com/lleb-me/wiki/issues/15) The ability to speak all three makes it impossible not to communicate with a member. We consider requests to add new official languages and requests to provide unofficial translations in other languages and welcome pull requests furthering translations. **Unofficial translations must declare what the official languages are and where to find official documentation.** It is internal policy to make available all 3 languages where possible.
- **Be creative and stupid—** LLEB in it of itself is a passion project. We wanted to make something that really hasn't been tried to the scale that we're trying right now: an internet gone intra. We're being stupid because it's not realistic. Challenge the norm. Make stupid mistakes. Learn from them.

## Inviting others into LLEB
You cannot directly invite someone into LLEB, ***however*** you can recommend to a staff member that someone is. Recommendations should be made via email with a body that is written formally and outlines clearly reasons why that person would be a good fit for LLEB. You must also affirm and attest that that person will follow the terms of membership. Failure for them to do so within an undescribed teething period may result in the suspension or removal of both them and yourself from LLEB.

## Leaving LLEB
Leaving the LLEB network is not recommended, even if you plan not to use it anymore. Membership is once-per-life, meaning leaving is possible, but re-joining is not. Exceptions are not possible to this rule. Upon your ultimate decision to leave the LLEB network, you can [request to delete your Tailscale account](https://tailscale.com/contact/support/), [uninstall Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1069/uninstall/?q=uninstall), and [delete your GitHub account.](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/deleting-your-user-account) To delete any data stored on you, please request directly to a LLEB staff member.
