## Choosing services
We miticulously choose services to help make sure we don't spend unneccessary time troubleshooting bugs, scrapping servers, and restarting from scratch. Anything we host must be:
- open-source with an open-source license
- able to use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard 
- support encryption by some means (in transit, at rest, end-to-end, et al.).

We do not choose services that may void your privacy or ours and do our best to limit all services to inside our network. We want all services to be fine in the event of, let's say the cable sharks attacking[^1].

## Choosing clients
When choosing clients, we have a strict criteria and a loose criteria. Both are flexible in additions, but must have all of these prerequesites:
- free to download
- open-source with an open-source license
- private or able to easily make private
- has a stable support for our services.

You do not have to use the clients that we recommend; in fact, we suggest that you do still do research into finding or making a client that works best for you. Our recommendations are purely meant to serve as a suggestion to getting up and running reliably.
