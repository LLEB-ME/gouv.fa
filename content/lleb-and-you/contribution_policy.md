title=" Contribution guidelines and penalties"
+++

If you decide to contribute to any service, you must follow these guidelines. Faliure to do so invokes the [3-strike system](#three-strikes).

- **Follow the guidelines provided for each service to a tee—** failure to do so can result in punishment regardless.
- **Do not upload illicit or illegal content—** we don't want to have to explain to LEO that you're a retard.
- **Do not upload pirated content—** we would never know, so this is unenforceable. But, this gives us deniability if we have to explain to LEO.

## Three Strikes
The Three Strikes system allows us to maintain quality content and prevent the lack thereof. Penalties are decided at the discretion of staff, with each case being handled differently depending on the situation at hand.

**1st incident—** Formal warning, deletion of upload<br/>
**2nd incident—** Final warning, deletion of upload, restriction of uploads<br/>
**3rd incident—** Deletion of upload, banned from uploads and restriction to read-only access
