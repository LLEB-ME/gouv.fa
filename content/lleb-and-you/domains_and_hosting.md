# Getting a domain name
People inside LLEB are able to request `.lleb` domains by contacting staff members. Your request should be done via a [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email) or [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/LLEB-ME/wiki/issues/new) with the body formatted in a similar fashion:
```
Domain(s): example.lleb
Reason for registration: Loreum ipsum
IP address to point to: 100.x.y.z OR (public IP)
```

Upon approval, you will receive a HTTPS certificate to secure your site. Although it is not required, we strongly suggest that all web managers use these methods. Your IP is used to not only point the domain but, in Tailscale, provide the necessary permissions for LLEB members to be able to access your site.

Domain names are public to LLEB members and cannot be made private. Just like the normal Internet, however, users must find your domain by some means to be able to know about it.

**Certain domain names will be rejected,** namely those that imply affiliation with the LLEB staff, the LLEB network, or specific members of LLEB staff. Other domain names may be prohibited from creation at the discretion of staff members.

## Getting your domain hosted inside the LLEB network
If you already have a domain outside of LLEB, you can request Git access to be able to mirror your website inside of LLEB to other LLEB members the fastest speeds to your website. Your request should be done in a similar fashion, ommiting the reason for registration and replacing it with a proof of ownership.
