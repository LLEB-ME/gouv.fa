We're not a government: so, we have a lot of flexibility to how we handle things such as policies, services, incidents, et al. We generally use a direct democracy to vote on procedures in this (`LLEB-ME/wiki`) GitHub repository.

# Voting for Services in LLEB
We consider suggestions for services when a member [creates an issue in this (`LLEB-ME/wiki`) GitHub repository.](https://github.com/LLEB-ME/wiki/issues/new) These requests must have a link to the service, the service's purpose, and why LLEB would benefit from the service. Votes are placed via reactions using `:+1:` to vote for and `:-1:` to vote against. You can decide not to vote.

Staff members may at their own discretion bring new services into deployment or exchange services for equivalents or better. Votes can be made via issues in this (`LLEB-ME/wiki`) GitHub repository to dispute changes like these.

# Promotion into Staff
There are two types of staff members: permanent and voted. There are three permanent seats, occupied by:
- Daniel Calderon—   founder
- Matthew Ronchetto— founder
- Vacancy

Permanent seats are not eligible for demotion unless by vote of staff (see `Demotion of Staff by Staff`). Voted seats can be made by nomination by creating an issue in this (`LLEB-ME/wiki`) GitHub repository citing the person being nominated, why they should be voted in, and an affirmation that they will continue to [follow the membership guidelines.](/MEMBERSHIP.md)

# Demotion of Staff
Upon demotion, the former staff member may still have access to the services that they host and maintained prior. If this member has a "power complex," they may be removed at the discretion of a staff member or by a vote of general majority.

## Vote by Members
A vote can be made to remove a staff member if a two-thirds vote is achieved to remove the member from their position.

## Vote by Staff
A vote can be made to remove any staff member if a two-thirds vote is achieved to remove the member from their position. Upon demotion, the staff members may further move to voting for eviction, in the event of reasonable cause, namely, but not limited to:
- intentional sabotage,
- intentional data leak,
- intentional data insecurity,
- spread of viruses and other malware,
- DDoS/DoS-ing, SWATting, and other physical attacks; and:
- mass evictions without reason.

# Voting for Policy Changes
Members can create issues and pull requests in this (`LLEB-ME/wiki`) GitHub repository to promote the changes of both written policy and service configurations that have been made public, such as Tailscale ACLs, Kubernetes pods, and miscellaneous services.
